# Awake! Young Men of England

Oh! give me the *strength* of the Lion,

The _wisdom_ of reynard the Fox

And then I’ll hurl troops at the Germans

And give them the hardest of knocks.


Oh! think of the War Lord’s mailed fist,

That is striking at England today:

And think of the lives that our soldiers

Are fearlessly _throwing away._


*Awake!* Oh you young men of England,

For if, when your Country’s in need,

You do not enlist by the thousand,

You truly are cowards indeed.
